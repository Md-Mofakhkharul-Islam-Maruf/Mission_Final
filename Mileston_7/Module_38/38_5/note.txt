Different ways of conditional rendering

You commented out three variations:

Way 1: Ternary operator
return isDone 
    ? <li>Task: {task} time: {time}</li> 
    : <li>Not done: {task} time= {time}</li>


✅ Shows one of two options based on isDone.

Way 2: Logical AND (&&)
return isDone && <li>Task: {task} time: {time}</li>


✅ Shows <li> only if isDone is true.

❌ If isDone is false, returns false, nothing renders.

Way 3: Logical OR (||)
return isDone || <li>Task: {task} time: {time}</li>


✅ Shows <li> only if isDone is false (because false || something evaluates to something).

This is less common but works for “show if NOT done”.

3️⃣ Using if-else (your final implementation)
let finalStatement;
if (isDone) {
    finalStatement = <li>Task: {task} time: {time}</li>
}else{
    finalStatement = <li>Not done: {task} time= {time}</li>
}
return finalStatement;


✅ Very clear and readable.

Good for beginners to understand conditional rendering logic.

Works exactly like the ternary operator, just more verbose.

4️⃣ Key takeaways

Props are read-only; you only use them, don’t modify.

Conditional rendering can be done via:

if-else

Ternary operator (? :)

Logical AND (&&) or OR (||)

Default props are useful for optional values (time = 0).

If you want, I can make a compact visual table showing all 3 conditional renderings with examples, so it’s easy to memorize for React.
