✅ 1. Definition
🔹 Dot Notation (.)

A method to access object properties using a dot.
Used when the property name is simple and follows JavaScript naming rules.

🔹 Bracket Notation ([])

A method to access object properties using square brackets.
Useful when property names are numbers, contain special characters, spaces, or are stored in variables.

✅ 2. Example + Breakdown
const person = {
    name: 'Maruf',
    age: 25,
    10: 'secret code',
    "co-de": 'jio'
}

// Dot notation
const personName = person.name;
console.log(personName); // Maruf

// Bracket notation
const secretKey = person[10];
console.log(secretKey); // secret code

const code = person["co-de"];
console.log(code); // jio


Breakdown:

person.name → Works because name is a simple key.

person[10] → Works because key is a number (dot cannot handle this).

person["co-de"] → Key has a hyphen, so you must use brackets.

✅ 3. Use Cases (When to Use Which?)
✅ Use Dot Notation:

When the key is simple like name, age, email

When you want clean, readable syntax

✅ Use Bracket Notation:

When the key contains:

Numbers → person[10]

Hyphens or special characters → person["co-de"]

Spaces → person["first name"]

When the property name is stored inside a variable

const key = "name";
console.log(person[key]); // Maruf

✅ 4. Pros and Cons (Combined View)
✅ Pros

✔ Dot notation is simple, clean, and easy to read
✔ Bracket notation works for all types of keys (numbers, hyphen, space, etc.)
✔ Bracket notation allows dynamic keys using variables
✔ Useful when working with API data or unknown property names

❌ Cons

✖ Dot notation cannot be used if the key has special characters, spaces, or starts with a number
✖ Dot notation does not work with dynamic (variable-based) keys
✖ Bracket notation is less readable and slightly longer
✖ No auto-complete suggestions in bracket notation
✖ More typing errors possible with brackets (quotes required)

✅ 5. Final Summary (One Line)

Use dot notation for simple/static keys → clean & easy.
Use bracket notation for dynamic or complex keys → powerful & flexible.
