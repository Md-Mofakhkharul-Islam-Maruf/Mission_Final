🔹 Array Destructuring
✅ Definition:

Array destructuring is a method to extract values from an array and store them into separate variables based on their index (position).

✅ Your Example Breakdown:
const name = ['maruf', 'munna', 'muhit'];
const [big, medium, small] = name;
console.log(small, medium, big);


✔ name is an array with 3 elements: 'maruf', 'munna', 'muhit'
✔ [big, medium, small] extracts values in order:
  • big = 'maruf'
  • medium = 'munna'
  • small = 'muhit'
✔ console.log(small, medium, big); prints → muhit munna maruf

✅ Merits of Array Destructuring:

Easy and Clean Syntax
➡ Avoids using name[0], name[1], etc.

Assign Multiple Values Quickly
➡ Multiple variables can be assigned in one line.

Improves Readability
➡ Code becomes simple, modern, and easy to understand.

❌ Demerits of Array Destructuring:

Order Dependent
➡ Values are assigned based on index. If order changes, variables get wrong values.

Undefined Values if Missing
➡ If array has fewer items, extra variables become undefined.

Hard to Use with Large Arrays
➡ Too many variables make the code messy and difficult to read.

🔹 Object Destructuring
✅ Definition:

Object destructuring is a method to extract specific values from an object using key names and store them in variables.

✅ Your Example Breakdown:
const person = {
    name: 'Maruf Hasan',
    age: 25,
    country: 'bangladesh'
};

const { age, country } = person;
console.log(country);


✔ person is an object with keys: name, age, country
✔ { age, country } extracts values by key names:
  • age = 25
  • country = 'bangladesh'
✔ console.log(country); prints → bangladesh

✅ Merits of Object Destructuring:

No Need for Dot Notation Repeats
➡ No need to write person.age, person.country again and again.

Order Doesn’t Matter
➡ Values are matched by key name, not index.

Can Rename Variables Easily
➡ Example:

const { country: nation } = person;
console.log(nation); // bangladesh

❌ Demerits of Object Destructuring:

Must Use Correct Property Name
➡ If key name is wrong (like contry instead of country), the result will be undefined.

Nested (Deep) Destructuring is Confusing
➡ Hard to read and debug when objects are inside objects.

Name Conflicts in Same Scope
➡ If a variable already exists with the same name, it can cause errors or overwrite it.
