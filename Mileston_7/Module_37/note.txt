1️⃣ Template String (Template Literal)

Real Definition:
Template strings (or template literals) are strings that allow embedded expressions, multi-line text, and interpolation in JavaScript. They are enclosed in backticks ` and can include variables or expressions inside ${}.

Example:

const firstName = "Maruf";
const lastName = "Hasan";
console.log(`My name is ${firstName} ${lastName}`);
// Output: My name is Maruf Hasan


${firstName} and ${lastName} are placeholders that dynamically insert variable values.

2️⃣ Arrow Function

Real Definition:
An arrow function is a concise syntax for writing functions in JavaScript using =>. Unlike traditional functions, arrow functions:

Can have an implicit return for single expressions.

Do not have their own this, so this refers to the surrounding lexical context.

Cannot be used as constructors with new.

Example:

const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(sum(8, 6)); 
// Output: 14


Equivalent traditional function:

function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

3️⃣ Spread Operator

Real Definition:
The spread operator ... allows an iterable (like an array or object) to be expanded into individual elements. It is commonly used to:

Merge arrays or objects

Copy arrays or objects

Pass elements as separate arguments to functions

Example:

const numbers = [1, 5, 9, 6, 4, 7, 3];
const newNumbers = [100, 65, 98, 36];
const finalNumber = [...newNumbers, ...numbers];
console.log(finalNumber);
// Output: [100, 65, 98, 36, 1, 5, 9, 6, 4, 7, 3]


[...newNumbers, ...numbers] merges the two arrays without modifying the originals.
